### Adding a New Intern Page

#### USCMS Software & Computing website
In order to add your information, we request you to please supply a photo ( First_Name-Last_Name.jpg or .png - 320x240 pixels) and a paragraph summarizing your project’s goals.

You should submit a pull request with the photo, a markdown file with the summary information above, and your proposal to this repo:

<https://github.com/uscms-software-and-computing/uscms-software-and-computing.github.io>

* Add a photo named `First-Last.jpg` or `.png` to the [assets/images/team folder](https://github.com/uscms-software-and-computing/uscms-software-and-computing.github.io/tree/master/assets/images/team). It should be 320x240 pixels.
* Add a pdf of your proposal named `First-Last.pdf` to the [assets/pdfs folder](https://github.com/uscms-software-and-computing/uscms-software-and-computing.github.io/tree/master/assets/pdfs).
* Add a "`<your github username>.md`" file to the [interns folder in the website repository](https://github.com/uscms-software-and-computing/uscms-software-and-computing.github.io/tree/master/pages/interns). Here is an example:

*Please Note*:  In the markdown file you create, ensure you set the “active” attribute to True – (i.e.  active: True).  Otherwise, your entry will not appear on our Interns page.

Be sure to include your project summary in the project_goal field.

You can leave the “presentations” and “current_status” fields blank for now.  (Make sure to include the fields)

Make sure to follow the format explicitly.  The file needs to include "---" characters are the top and bottom of this header section.  The tabs and spaceing are important as well.

Anything between "<>" characters should be replaced with your information without the "<>" characters (i.e. <your GitHub user id> becomes rct225, not <rct225>)

### Dates
Date format for start and end dates should be -- YYYY-MM-DD -- i.e. 2021-12-31

You can test changes to your page by following the directions found in the [README](https://github.com/uscms-software-and-computing/uscms-software-and-computing.github.io) file for the website repository.
