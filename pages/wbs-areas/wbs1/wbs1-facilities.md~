## Overview

Facilities are responsible for establishing the necessary computing resources for storage, network, batch and other services to ...

The facilities are members of the [Open Science Grid (OSG)](https://opensciencegrid.org/) consortium.

### Services
- Distributed Compute
- Distributed disk and tape storage
- Networking

The difference between the total and central production usage is physics analysis. Note that before August 2017, production usage fluctuated due to inconsistent queue depth, while since then the sites have been consistently and fully utilized. Some months total usage is more than the purchased processing capacity due to opportunistic cycles used at campus clusters or HPCâ€™s." %}

### Networking and Security
The facilities area also oversees operations in the U.S. in the area of networking, where we participate in various network capacity and capability studies in planning future needs.
