## Overview

The R&D area coordinates the centralized R&D effort for tackling the challenges in computing, data, and analysis during DUNE's lifecycle.  This R&D area is organized into five sub-areas:

- *Framework*: Design and develop new software framework for DUNE production workflows with the capability of handling flexible sized data grains to allow efficient handling of event sizes in the range of KB to GB.
- *Persistency*: Develop and integrate persistence infrastructure to support the new framework and allow for eager writing and on-demand reading of data in multiple grain sizes. Implement new storage technologies, such as ROOT RNTuple, allowing data support during DUNE's lifecycle and beyond.
- *Acelerator Integration*: Provide data models, tools and abstraction to allow DUNE algorithms to use Compute Accelerators such as GPU.
- *Platform Evolution and Sustainability*: Investigate and plan for the use of new platforms, including existing and emerging HPC, by DUNE computing. Especially focusing on making DUNE computing more sustainable by allowing the utilization of more energy efficient computing resources.
- *Analysis infrastructure*: Developing new facilities and approaches for analysis during DUNE's lifecycle.

There are significant collaborations with other projects such as [OSG](www.osg-htc.org), [HEP-CCE](https://hepcce.org/), [ESNet](http://es.net/).
