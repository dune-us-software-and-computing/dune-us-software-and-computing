# Overview

- **Mission:** “to develop and operate the software and computing resources necessary to process CMS data expeditiously and to enable U.S. physicists to fully participate in the physics of CMS.”

- U.S. CMS leadership in S&C enables U.S. physicists to perform the most important and highest-profile analyses

- Continued U.S. investment in S&C is critical for the success of U.S. physicists
  - Ongoing operation of infrastructure and maintenance of software
  - Future evolution to enable HL-LHC


- Trends
  - Community software efforts
  - Accelerators as new hardware architectures
  - R&D collaborations (IRIS-HEP, CCE, OSG, HSF, ESnet, WLCG, Fermilab, U.S. CMS universities, and U.S. ATLAS)
