project_goal: >
  Develop heteogeneous Particle Flow (PF) reconstruction for the CMS Phase 2 detector, including the new detector elements. With expected significantly increased nteraction rates, we need a computationally efficient PF reconstruction algorithm to process events with a sufficient rate. Therefore, another main goal of this proposal is to update the time consuming parts of PF reconstruction to parallel-processing -friendly algorithms that run on heterogeneous computing resources.
