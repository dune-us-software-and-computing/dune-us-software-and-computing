project_goal: >
  With the upgrade to the High Luminosity LHC, the demands for offline computing resources in CMS will grow immensely.  Both additional computing resources and new ideas for how to process the data are needed to ensure that CMS can continue to produce high quality scientific results.  The recently developed SONIC framework simplifies the usage of accelerators such as GPUs and FPGAs in both offline production and triggering within the CMS computing workflow.  Our team aims to turn heterogeneous computing into a major research effort within CMS.
